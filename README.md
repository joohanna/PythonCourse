#The script should read a file and calculate the average lifetime and standard deviation of a hydrogenbond contact.

1. Read file #list with file names for dynamical propagation of contacts which the program should calculate lifetime for.
2. While iterating over this list of filenames
    a. Open the file #each row in the file contains the number 1 (the contact is present at that frame number) or 0 (the contact is not present at that frame number)
    b. Save the rows in an array #contactPropagation
    c. Iterate over that array to generate a list of lifetimes
        a. If the array[i]=1 -> lifetime+=1 #update a variable called lifetime
           Else if array[i]=0 and lifetime â‰¥ 1 -> append lifetime to the array LifetimeList
           Else -> continue #continue to iterate over the array
    d. From the list LifetimeList calculate average lifetime for the contact, standard deviation and max and min lifetime
    e. use a residue libary file to give the contact the correct name.
    f. save the contact in a class called Lifetime
3. Foreach contact saved as an object in the class Lifetime; print the attributes.
